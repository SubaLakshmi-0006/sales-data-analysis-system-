# Sales Performance Analysis (Python & SQL)

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic data cleaning using Python and sales analysis using SQL.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas)
- MySQL
- SQL
- GitHub

## Work Done
- Removed extra rows from raw data
- Converted incorrect data types
- Loaded cleaned data into MySQL
- Wrote a JOIN-based SQL query to analyze sales and profit

## SQL Analysis
The SQL query calculates total sales and profit grouped by state and category.

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand real-world data cleaning and SQL joins.

## Dataset Note
The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository.
This is to avoid sharing large files and sensitive data.
However, the data cleaning steps and SQL queries are fully available.
